# lang_interpreter
This is a testing lang interpret to learn about the concepts of creating and running a programming language. This project will later be used in the chess_ai_server.

Currently the language support evaluating numerical and logical expressions with following operator precedence:

Precedence | Operator
------------ | -------------
1 | =
2 | * /
3 | + -
4 |< > == !=
5 | && \|\|

Further the languge support assigning values to a variable a printing the variable value with the "print()" function. It has basic typechecking as the variables can take both Numerical and Logical values.
